The following steps show how to install the library on your system:

## Download the library .zip file

The latest version of the library can be found in the project's [release page](http://github.com/end2endzone/NonBlockingRTTTL/releases/latest).

Each released version of the library contains 3 files:
* The library archive installer in .zip format (identified as `NonBlockingRtttl.vX.Y.Z.zip`)
* The library project source code in .zip format (identified as `Source code (zip)`)
* The library project source code in tar.gz (identified as `Source code (tar.gz)`)

Download the `library archive installer` from an existing tags and extract the content to a local directory (for example `c:\my_arduino_libraries`).
